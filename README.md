# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect use of <dialog> element

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the use of the HTML `<dialog>` element.  The issue arises from not properly associating a close button with the dialog, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to close the dialog using JavaScript.

The `bug.html` file showcases the problematic code, where clicking the button does not close the dialog because the button is not correctly linked to the dialog.

The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version of the code, ensuring the button correctly interacts with the dialog and closes it when clicked.

This bug is uncommon because it highlights a subtle interaction between HTML elements and JavaScript event handling, and understanding this interaction is vital for building robust web applications.
